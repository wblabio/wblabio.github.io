### Add more Google Ads conversion IDs and conversion labels

> In case you are using more than one Google Ads account to target your shop, this is for you. 

In order to be able to track traffic and conversions within all accounts, there are two approaches. 

1. Create a Google Ads manager account and link all Google Ads accounts for that shop under that Google Ads manager account. Once done, create a conversion pixel within the new Google Ads manager account. It is a shared pixel for all sub accounts and will track all traffic and conversions for those sub accounts.
