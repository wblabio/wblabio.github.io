### Test order

?> In order to find out if the conversion tracking works the best way is to test it by placing an order and wait until conversion are reported. Please follow the instructions **exactly**. All steps are important in order to ensure a valid test. 

1. Turn off any kind of caching and / or minification plugins (because the can break the tracking code). 
2. Log out of the shop (because admins and shop managers are excluded from tracking).
3. Turn off any kind of ad or script blocker in your browser (because the can disable the tracking code).
4. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
5. Purchase an item from your shop.
6. Wait up to 48 hours until the conversion shows up in Google Ads. (usually takes only a few hours)
