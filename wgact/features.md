## Highlights

- Tracking Pixels
 
 The plugin provides a variety of the most common tracking pixels for e-commerce such as Google Ads, Google Analytics, Facebook, Microsoft Ads and more. 

 You can use just one, or a selection of tracking pixels that suite your own purpose best.

 The plugin covers all of the core features that each pixel provides. Beta features are on the development roadmap and will be implemented soon. 
 
- Powerful control layer, yet simple to use
 
 The design principles for the plugin are simplicity and accuracy. That means we designed the user interface to be very simple to use. At the same time we pay a lot of attention to the logic beneath the surface to make the tracking pixels work as accurate as technically possible. 

 The plugin's powerful, internal pixel manager controls all the pixels and their settings, while making it very easy for the user to adjust the behavior globally.  

 Wherever possible, the internal pixel manager automatically detects the best settings for the specific environment which allows to keep the user interface uncluttered and as light as possible. 

 And, the plugin is very developer friendly. It provides hooks and filters to enable users to adjust the plugin behavior in ways that we didn't think of. 

- Privacy features

 Privacy concerns and new regulation have driven a development of many new Consent Management Platforms (CMPs). At the same time the pixel providers (like Google and Facebook) have implemented new features into their tracking pixels that give the website visitors much more control over the data collected. 

 The plugin integrates seamlessly with the most popular Consent Management Platforms and implements all of the new tracking pixel privacy features available to date.
