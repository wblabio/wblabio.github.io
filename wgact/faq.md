### What is the new "opt in" feature in your plugin? Opt in to what?

We started to collect telemetry from users who are willing to share some data with us, like WooCommerce, WordPress and PHP versions, or the shop language:

 <details>
 <summary>image (Click to expand)</summary>

 ![Telemetry](_media/telemetry.png)
 </details>

This will help us to better prioritize our development roadmap for the plugin. For example we’ve been working on translations recently and didn’t know which ones would be the most important ones (the ones with the highest user count). Unfortunately the wordpress.org repository doesn’t provide us much data about that.  

Also we will invest more time to build even more useful features and possibly add some pro features too.

If you wish to help us on this way, you can opt in, but it is absolutely voluntary and won’t change how the plugin works in any way.
